# City Explorer

**Author**: Andrew Curtis
**Version**: 2.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if we make more commits past first submission)

## Overview

I will be building a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. Working with a new partner each day, I will request data from various third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. In the later stages of this week's project I will be persisting data in a SQL database.

Each day of this project I and my pair-programming partner will deploy this back end app as a new instance on Heroku.

I will be hooking up the back-end app to the front-end code base for the client, but I will not be modifying the client-side code in any way.

## Getting Started

Site is deployed to Heroku, so user must have internet connection, visit the deployed front end of the City Explorer app (https://codefellows.github.io/city_explorer/), and enter into the form the URL of the deployed back end (https://lab-06-city-explorer.herokuapp.com/). 

## Architecture

For this project I will be using the following technologies: 

* **Languages:** JavaScript, SQL
* **Libraries and frameworks:** jQuery, Handlebars.js, Node.js, Express, 
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Deployment platform:** Heroku
* **APIs:** Google Geocoding, Dark Sky

## Change Log

`02-19-2019 9:00am` - Created Heroku app in repo for the app. No content to deploy yet. Pushed to Heroku and verified that instance is successfully running. Renamed Heroku app to `lab-06-city-explorer`. Need to have deployable app before `heroku open` will work.
`02-19-2019 10:40am` - Filled out initial server variables and helper functions. Tested that server works.
